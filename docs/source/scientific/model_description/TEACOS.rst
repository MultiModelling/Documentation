TEACOS is a Dutch-based mathematical optimization model focusing on mid-
to long-term investment analysis. Refer to
https://multimodelling.readthedocs.io/en/latest/energy_models/TEACOS/index.html
for more overall information regarding the model.

General model information
=========================

General model information questions were asked regarding basic
information, model versions, and point of contact for questions. The
TEACOS model is developed and maintained by QUOMARE.

A second set of questions was asked regarding whether the model is type
or token, the intended purpose of the model, and the level of decision
that the model aims to support. We understand that the model can be
categorized as type and token model. The model focuses on
techno-economic optimization, which is capable of long-term planning by
considering investment decisions in technology options.

Typical questions asked of the model include future capacities and
energy supplies for different technology options. One of the significant
strengths of the model is its openness, i.e., user-defined system.
TEACOS finds the best combination of technology options while
considering optimal investment and operational decisions. One of the
critical limitations of the model is the assumption of perfect
foresight. The model has been used to identify the presence/absence of
different

technologies in a targeted energy system analysis. Refer to the table
below for further discussion on these aspects.

The next set of questions are regarding the modeling paradigm,
implementation environment, and license. The model applies multiple
formalisms, such as mathematical equations and logical expressions. The
model is implemented using a modeling package called AIMMS. An AIMMS
license is needed, and the owner can share the model.

Model content
=============

A preliminary set of model content questions were related to energy
system integration and scope. The model does not represent an integrated
energy system. The model's essential elements and concepts include
detailed information on costs/prices, such as investment profiles or
return on investments. Similarly, content-wise, the model contains
important supply-related technology options and their interactions.

The next set of content-related questions included scale and resolution.
There is no spatial representation but rather a topology and visual
representation on a map for communication. The temporal scale is
long-term (2020 - 2050).

The next set of questions is related to model assumptions, model inputs,
parameters, and outputs, and data sources related to the model. One of
the assumptions likely to be contested by others is that the model
considers the time-slice approach for faster processing speed, which is
problematic for analyzing peak loads for electricity. The model standard
input format is MS Access, and the output format is MS Excel. Some
important model inputs are technology inputs (supply options) and costs
(annualized investments, fixed, variable, and operation and maintenance
costs). Similarly, some important model outputs are secondary energy
demand-supply balances and system costs. Data can be shared with
permission from model owners.

Continuing with the model content, there were questions regarding
verification, validation, and test, and uncertainty descriptions. The
answer to test coverage of the model is that TEACOS is continuously
developed using internal test sets to reference models. Internal review
before the branch merges into the master branch on GitHub. Verification,
validation, and testing can be done on boundary conditions and input
limits/ranges.
