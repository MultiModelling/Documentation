OPERA is a Dutch-based national energy system model focusing on total
system cost minimization. Refer to
https://multimodelling.readthedocs.io/en/latest/energy_models/CTM/index.html
for more overall information regarding the model.

General model information
=========================

General model information questions were asked regarding basic
information, model versions, and point of contact for questions. The CTM
model is developed and maintained by Kalavasta.

A second set of questions was asked regarding whether the model is type
or token, the intended purpose of the model, and the level of decision
that the model aims to support. We understand that the model can be
categorized as a token model as it analyzes the feedstock and energy
balance of the Dutch energy-intensive industries. The model focuses on
large industrial sites and performs bottom-up calculations. The model
considers location-specific demand and supply values under different
future scenario conditions. The long-term strategy is discussions
between industries, grid operators, and the government regarding what
energy infrastructure type would be needed for climate neutrality.

One of the model's strengths is the ability to perform energy and mass
balance analyses of specific industrial sites. The model has been used
to create the II3050 infrastructure outlook for the Dutch industry to
provide demand profiles to industrial sites for specific future years,
such as 2025 and 2030, based on pre-existing scenarios.

The next set of questions are regarding the modeling paradigm,
implementation environment, and license. The model applies multiple
formalisms, such as one-shot calculations, mass and energy flow-based
calculations, mathematical expressions and equations, and graph or
network-based calculations. The model uses JAVA-based web applications
for online spreadsheets. The model is implemented in Excel spreadsheets.
Therefore, no specific license is required to run the model.

Model content
=============

A preliminary set of model content questions were related to energy
system integration and scope. The model does not represent an integrated
energy system. The model fully covers industries; however, heat
integration is still in development.

Essential elements and concepts the model includes are most energy
carriers used by Dutch industries, such as Electricity, natural gas,
hydrogen, heat, and others (including different types of methane,
biowaste/non-biowaste, biomass, waste, carbon monoxide, etc.). No
specific attention is paid to including flexibility options.

The next set of content-related questions included scale and resolution.
The spatial scale of the model is the national level, and the temporal
scale is one future target year, approximately 30 years ahead. The
spatial resolution is industry site or cluster level.

The next set of questions is related to model assumptions, model inputs,
parameters, and outputs, and data sources related to the model. One of
the critical assumptions is that material and energy balance need to add
up for every industrial site. Industries emitting <100 kT CO2 are not
included in the analysis. Electricity production is not included, but
facilities having their own power production are included in the
analysis. One may contest the level of detail in describing a site. Some
mass/energy streams might be missed. Some important model inputs are the
costs of energy carriers, investments in technologies, annualized
investment costs, costs of carbon emissions (the carbon pricing system
is in place), and the infrastructure cost at the national level.
Similarly, some important model outputs are emissions, demand, cost,
etc., at the cluster, sector, and national levels.

Continuing with the model content, there were questions regarding
verification, validation, and test, and uncertainty descriptions. There
is limited testing on verification, validation, and testing within the
model. Mass balance checking could be implemented in Excel. One of the
validation methods is feedback from industrial partners, i.e., the
qualitative method. Similarly, base year data is matched with publicly
available data.
