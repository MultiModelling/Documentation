Energy Potential Scan (EPS)
===========================

The Energy Potential Scan for Business Parks (EPS) gives a first order estimate for the business case for
sustainable energy measures on business parks, for individual companies and for the business park as a whole.
It has been developed in practice and successfully applied for more than 100 business parks in the Netherlands,
also as a commercial product. It does not require company-specific data for a first estimate, as it uses
geographical and other data which is open or commercially available on a national scale. Therefore, it is a
relatively quick and cost-effective scan. The results are presented at the building-level and can be visualized
using GIS. The results are also available in ESDL.
