ESSIM (Energy System Simulator)
===============================

The Energy System Simulator (ESSIM) is a discrete time simulation tool and collection of models that calculates energy
flows in assets and the effects thereof, in an interconnected hybrid energy system over a period of time. With the help
of the energy flows ESSIM calculates, one can get insights into how well the assets in a network are dimensioned, if
there is overloading in any given transport asset (like pipe, cables, etc.) and what the effect of storage is in any
part of the network.
