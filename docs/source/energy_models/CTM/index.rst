Carbon Transition Model (CTM)
=============================

The Carbon Transition Model (CTM) is a tool to explore pathways to zero emissions for the Dutch industry as
well as future industries that produce synthetic molecules (from carbon, water and electricity). Industrial
activity is modelled according to historic public data and has been validated. The user can explore a future
year by making changes to a reference 'base year' scenario. The model then provides information on changes to
emissions, costs, energy and feedstock, technology choices, infrastructure and much more.

The model covers the entire Dutch industry. The largest energy intensive industrial sites are modelled using
a bottom-up approach. This includes steel, refineries, fertilizer plants, large base chemical plants including
steam crackers, industrial gases and methanol production, some inorganic chemical plants for salt, chlorine
and petrochemical catalyst production as well as waste incineration plants. The remainder of Dutch industry
has been modelled using a top-down approach based on national energy statistics and site specific emission
data.

The model gives information about these industries at the national level (The Netherlands), industry sector
level, cluster level (Rotterdam, Zeeland, Groningen, Noordzee Kanaalgebied, Chemelot and Cluster 6) and site
level.
